Calculator made in common lisp. Learned User input and basic Lisp syntax.

Go to  [macports](https://www.macports.org/install.php) and install for your OS. I skipped the Xcode step.  
once installed, enter your terminal and type: 


```bash

Please run

```bash

In terminal and it will prompt you for 2 numbers. it will give you the added, subtracted, multiplied, divided, and modulo of the 2 numbers. For syntax highlighting download Lisp by Yasuhiro Matsumoto in the vscode extensions marketplace.
